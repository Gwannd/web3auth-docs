Authentication Service Providers enable you to use some implicit and authorization code grants. You could also use social providers on top of
Federated / Identity providers to select other Social providers (e.g.: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively supported
by us. Note: This will require you to register an app with the Authentication Service Providers.

This guide will help you to set up the following Authentication Service Providers:

- [Auth0](#auth0)
- [AWS Cognito](#aws-cognito)
- [Firebase](#firebase)

## Auth0

1. Create an Auth0 verifier by choosing `Social Login Providers` and selecting `Auth0` from the **Login Provider** dropdown.

2. Select the `Authentication Type` from the dropdown based on your application needs.

   > Note: For Email Password and Email Passwordless authentication, the `email_verified = true` condition is added to the JWT verification. To avoid
   > JWT params mismatch error, you can use any other Authentication Type.

3. Enter the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` from your Auth0 application. See how to create a new Auth0 application
   [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/).

4. Fill the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` details and select `Sub` or `Email` as the JWT Verifier ID.
