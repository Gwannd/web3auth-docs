The Multi Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them login into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

You can set the mfaLevel within the `loginParams` to customize when mfa screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`default`** - Setting the mfaLevel to default will present the MFA screen to user on every third login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.DEFAULT`
- **`optional`** - Setting mfaLevel to optional will present the MFA screen to user on every login but user will have the option to skip it.
  `mfaLevel = MFALevel.OPTIONAL`
- **`mandatory`** - Setting mfaLevel to mandatory will make it mandatory for user to setup MFA after login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.MANDATORY`
- **`none`** - Setting mfaLevel to none will skip the mfa setup screen totally. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.NONE`

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA
screen will continue to appear if the user has enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.
