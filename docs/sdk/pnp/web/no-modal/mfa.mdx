At Web3Auth, we prioritize your security by offering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is an extra layer of protection that verifies your
identity when accessing your account. To ensure ownership, you must provide two or more different backup factors. You have the option to choose from
the device, social, backup factor (seed phrase), and password factors to guarantee access to your Web3 account. Once you create a recovery factor, MFA
is enabled, and your keys are divided into three shares for off-chain multi-sig, making the key self-custodial. With backup factors, you can easily
recover your account if you lose access to your original device or helps login into a new device.

For a dApp, we provide various options to set up Multi-Factor Authentication. You can customize the MFA screen by setting the `mfaLevel` argument. You
can enable or disable a backup factor and change their order. Currently, there are four values for `mfaLevel`:

- `default`: presents the MFA screen every third login
- `optional`: presents the MFA screen on every login, but you can skip it
- `mandatory`: make it mandatory to set up MFA after login
- `none`: skips the MFA setup screen

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA
screen will continue to appear if the user has enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.

:::note Minimum Growth plan required

This is a paid feature and the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the
**Growth Plan**. You can use this feature in the development environment for free.

## Installing Openlogin Adapter

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin). Natively, it is already present and preconfigured
within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations, you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

## Configuring Openlogin Adapter

While instantiating the Openlogin Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor. One of these configurations is the
`loginSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes in the adapter, enabling add more settings to your login function using web3auth.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for
customisations.
