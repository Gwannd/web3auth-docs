import ShowWCScanner from "@site/src/common/sdk/pnp/web/_plugin-showwcscanner.mdx";

For enabling interoperability with Wallet Connect, ie. connecting your W3A generated wallet to other dApps which have Wallet Connect integration, you
can use the `showWalletConnectScanner()` method. This method uses the Wallet Connect `copy and paste` flow, in which you can directly copy the QR Code
details from a dApp like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and paste in it your shown modal.

:::note

This is a paid feature and the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the **Growth
Plan**. You can use this feature in the development environment for free.
